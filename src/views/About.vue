      Makerspaces have a significant impact on the learning of students, the development of entrepreneurial skills and the personal development.
</p><p>
The number of Fablabs and MakerSpaces in Europe has increased greatly in the last decade. And thatâ€™s a good thing because Makerspaces work towards democratizing access to technology and often have the aim to also actively support the future of young people.
</p><p>
The benefits of educational makerspaces are numerous and diverse. While they do not come without their challenges, makerspaces can have a significant impact on student learning and development.
</p><p>
A true makerspace offers student-driven opportunity for open-ended exploration for everyone. A great makerspace is personalized, deep (allowing deeper learning), empowering, equitable, differentiated, intentional and inspiring.
</p><p>
Great makerspaces democratize learning. Yet, we need to hear more discussion about how these spaces can be used by all learning groups, in particular pupils and students that are missing motivation and are at risk to leave school and become a NEET (not in Education, Employment or Training).
</p><p>
We are convinced that MakerSpaces are in the unique position of offering training and education to these youngsters and motivate them not becoming a NEET. We believe that MakerSpaces can also enhance entrepreneurial skills among this NEET target group.
